(Scattered brainstorming)

Subgame, ASSS, Continuum, and the original Subspace client combine arena and
player lists.  Thus in a given arena there is a set of players and anything 
that happens inside the arena is visible, more or less, to the entire arena.

Some exceptions are events that clients see differently based on their team 
(like stealth, cloak, ship colors etc.) or if they are in spectator mode.  But
for the most part, there are arenas, and you get updates on everything 
happening in your arena.

In chasm's game server, I separate "groups of players" (who all can see each 
other's activities) from "arenas" (which now contain these groups).
The idea is to allow concurrent games in a single arena such that people in
each game (and those spectating) can see only their group's activities but
still chat with players in the arena who happen to be in another group.

Groups need not be mutually exclusive.  So players in an arena can belong to
one or many groups.
